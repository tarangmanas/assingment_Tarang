You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.

1. kubectl get service
2.  The application i.e the containers should have the ports too eg. 80
3. Check the target port 
4. Check for lables  kubectl get nodes --show-labels / kubectl get po --show-labels
5. check the service if its down or not
