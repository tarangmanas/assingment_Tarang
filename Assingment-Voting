Observation:

On deleting the first voting Pod:
New pod gets created 
Voting & Result both were working


On deleting the worker pod:
New worker pod got created 
Voting & Result were working fine
Logs also gets deleted as there was no error handeling file sepearate coding done

On deleting the db pod:
New db pod got created 
nce the db gets deleted 
The worker pod tries to connect to the db.
But because the db was deleted and took all its data also 
So, container in pod restarted itself and tries to connect to db
And get connected to it once the db comes up
Voting page was still working
Result page was not working it got stuck

Common observations:
We know that on deleting the pod the logs also gets deleted so we should have seperate  log file handeling not depending on the pod 
In our case also, The Result starts updating but the old data are lost
On deleting the pod its data gets deleted 
The pod is stateless

Solution to fix the problem:
Result app was connected to db in socket connection or synchronous connection if this fails then it will not be able to fetch the data 
So, Give restart to result pod and again result page will start working with new votes
